"""Bake the per-point evidence into a labelling batch, at build time.

Why baked, and why this file exists
-----------------------------------
``app/label_app.html`` is hosted statically -- a folder on a bucket, no
always-on service -- and Earth Engine sign-in is on the critical path for
*imagery only*. Everything an interpreter needs that is not a picture is
therefore computed **once, here, at batch build time** and carried inside the
batch JSON: point values, an annual index timeline, an annual land-cover
sequence, terrain and water. The whole labelling loop renders and works with
Earth Engine never signed in. Losing the Sentinel-2 chips is acceptable; losing
the app is not.

What goes in, and why each of them
----------------------------------
Section P of ``docs/research/TWOTOWER_RESEARCH.md`` is the standing verdict
here: a single-date auxiliary path is bought on **error independence**, not on
accuracy. Every dataset below gets its answers wrong in ways that have nothing
to do with how the deployed AlphaEarth two-tower gets them wrong, which is the
only reason any of it is worth an interpreter's attention. The model's own
posterior is not in this file and is not evidence -- it is the thing being
corrected, and on the two visible map errors it is confident and wrong.

1. **Core point values.** Dynamic World 2018/2024 mode plus built/crop/tree
   probability means; ESA WorldCover 2020 (v100) *and* 2021 (v200), because the
   two disagree and the disagreement is itself informative; Hansen ``lossyear``
   from the 2025 v1_13 vintage -- v1_11 stops at 23 and the label window ends in
   2024; GHSL built surface per epoch; per-year clear-scene counts, so a flat
   timeline can be told apart from an empty one.
2. **Annual index timeline 2017-2025.** Growing-season medians of NDVI, NDMI and
   NBR plus the six raw S2 SR band medians (B2, B3, B4, B8, B11, B12), so the
   spectral profile in the app needs no further network call. The cloud recipe
   is the inspector's: ``COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED`` joined to
   ``S2_CLOUD_PROBABILITY``, probability < 40, SCL shadow/cloud/cirrus dropped.
3. **ESRI 10 m Annual Land Cover 2017-2023.** Annual and 10 m with an explicit
   Crops class, so it names a change *year* rather than bracketing one.
4. **Terrain and water.** Copernicus DEM slope, a WorldCover bare-ground flag,
   JRC Global Surface Water occurrence. These are the two §AL-T stable-class map
   errors -- mountains read as built-up, wetlands read as cropland -- made
   visible at the point where they are being labelled.

Two things this gets right that a naive version does not
--------------------------------------------------------
**The growing season is latitude-aware.** ``c2c_ts_server.py``, which the S2
recipe is taken from, hardcodes June-September because it is a Europe-only tool.
These points are drawn globally: a southern-hemisphere point composited over
June-September is its *dry* season, and the whole timeline is then misleading in
a way that looks like data. The window flips by hemisphere, the tropics get the
full year, and which was used is recorded in the payload rather than assumed.

**The extraction is batched -- but on two different axes, and the difference is
the whole lesson here.**

For the *point-value* datasets (Dynamic World, WorldCover, Hansen, GHSL, ESRI,
terrain) the batching axis is **points**: one ``reduceRegions`` over a chunk of
them per dataset. A hundred points times twenty datasets times a round trip each
is an afternoon; chunked it is a minute.

For the *Sentinel-2 timeline* that axis does not work at all, and the reason is
structural rather than a matter of tuning: **Earth Engine evaluates in tiles.**
A request is costed by the tiles it has to touch, so a batch of points that fall
in the same tile is nearly free to add to, and a batch of points that do not is
one request that must materialise every one of their tiles at once. These points
are a **global equal-area draw** -- consecutive points are on different
continents by construction -- so a request covering twenty of them makes the
cloud-probability join materialise scenes across several continents, and Earth
Engine answers **"User memory limit exceeded"**. At 100 points, and still at 20:
lowering the chunk size does not fix a problem whose cost is the spread.

So **widely-spread points are mapped over independently**: the timeline makes
one request per **(point, year)**, with ``filterBounds`` on that single point
keeping each year's collection to the scenes that actually touch it. Measured,
at one point: a single year is **2.4 s**; nine years of one band each is 5.7 s;
nine years of all ten bands **times out**. So the unit is the point-year.

**Budget it as roughly 20 s per point, not 2.4.** The ~900 point-years of a
100-point batch go through a thread pool, but a measured end-to-end run took
**36 minutes**, not the ~2 the per-request timing predicts: Earth Engine
rate-limits interactive `getInfo` calls, so sixteen workers buy far less than
sixteen times the throughput. That is fine -- this is a build step run once per
round, not something an interpreter waits on -- but do not size a labelling
round on the optimistic arithmetic.

The chunked, points-batched path survives only for the point-value datasets,
which are plain per-pixel lookups with no collection to reduce and are therefore
cheap to sample anywhere.
