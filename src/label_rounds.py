"""Pull a labelling round back out of the sheet and read what it actually bought.

Without this the campaign is write-only. `build_label_batches.py` sends points
out, `app/label_app.html` collects calls, and this closes the loop: it fetches
the rows, writes them where the next round can exclude them, and computes the
one number `ACTIVE_LEARNING.md` says the campaign is bought on and has never
measured --

    **confirmed plots per point, per class, per channel**

-- together with the falsification test that section states in advance:

> if the acquisition surface's realised confirmed-plot rate is not >= 2x the
> equal-area baseline on the binding class, it is not worth the complexity and
> the campaign should go back to random draws with the pilot's sizing.

That test needs an equal-area arm in the same round to compare against, which is
why `--placeholder` in `build_label_batches.py` builds one and why `random` is a
first-class channel rather than a stand-in. With no `random` rows present the
enrichment column is reported as unavailable rather than as 1.0 -- a missing
control is not a passing control.

It also reports the **calibration** batches separately -- rows carrying a known
`reference`, worked by every interpreter before their first real batch. Read the
pattern rather than the percentage: one person consistently calling long fallow
`Cropland` is a briefing that can be fixed in ten minutes, and it looks nothing
like the same headline number made of scattered singletons. Calibration rows are
excluded from the yield table, because a reference plot is an exercise, not a
plot the campaign found.

Two things it also measures because they are cheap here and expensive later
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Inter-rater agreement**, from points labelled by more than one person. The
  ledger's standing verdict is that the change-F1 ceiling is set by
  `Cropland`/`Nature` label noise, so the campaign's own disagreement rate on
  that boundary is the ceiling it is buying against. `build_label_batches.py
  --experts` double-labels ~5% of every batch and this fills in.

  **Everything here groups on `expert_id`, never on the display name.** "Ann",
  "ann", "Ann " and "Anne" are four experts to a groupby and the failure is
  silent: the agreement number is computed over nothing and reports a clean
  100%. `expert_id` comes from the roster in `app/config.js`, is part of the
  sheet's upsert key, and is the only thing here that identifies a person.
* **Seconds per point**, from the app's own timing. This is what prices a
  1,250-point round in interpreter-days, and the design's whole justification is
  a ratio of compute hours to interpreter months.
