"""Bake a batch's Sentinel-2 filmstrips to static files, once, before anybody
labels.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
It is `scripts/warm_ts_cache.py` from the DIST-ALERT inspector, for a host with
no server to cache in.

That inspector feels instant and this app did not, and the reason is not a
technique: `c2c_ts_server.py` computes **nothing** before a click either -- its
own docstring says the cache fills lazily, one pixel at a time. What makes the
difference is that somebody has already paid Earth Engine for that pixel, either
by clicking it before or by `warm_ts_cache.py` walking the review list through
the server ahead of the session. A cold chip costs what it costs. The only move
anyone has is to stop the interpreter's look at a point from being the first
one, and the app's in-session prefetch only manages that from the second point
onwards, for someone already moving.

Here the "review list" is known completely and in advance -- it is the batch --
so the whole filmstrip can be paid for at build time, next to the evidence bake
that already runs. After this, opening a point costs **one static file** and no
Earth Engine at all.

ONE FILE PER POINT, NOT NINE
----------------------------
Each point's nine years are baked into a single horizontal sprite and sliced in
the browser with `background-position`.

Worth knowing, because it looks like it contradicts the ledger: §AL9 measured
one mosaicked request against nine parallel ones **live** and it LOST on four
points of five -- Earth Engine parallelises nine separate requests across its
own backend better than it parallelises one large thumbnail. That verdict is
about Earth Engine's scheduler and does not carry over to a static file, where
one request is simply one request. The idea was right and only the setting was
wrong.

ALL FOUR RGB SCHEMES
--------------------
The first version baked the default scheme only, on an estimate of ~40 KB per
point and "30 MB for six schemes almost nobody switches to". The measured bake
is **24 KB median**, so the four three-band schemes are ~10 MB for a 100-point
batch -- and the thing the estimate was trading away turned out to be sharp:
switching scheme on an unbaked one drops to live Earth Engine at ~30 s a point,
or to no image at all for anyone not signed in. The index schemes (NDVI/NDMI/
NBR) are still live: they are one normalised difference through a ramp, they do
not clip, and they are cheap.

THE RAMP IS PER POINT
---------------------
See `STRETCH_PCT`. The fixed bounds in `COMBOS` are a single ramp for a global
draw and they saturate: a quarter of the chip1 bake of b001 was one flat colour.
The ramp is now measured from each point's own nine years, ONE ramp shared by
the three channels so hue -- which the legend and the tips teach as a convention
-- is preserved, and shared by the years so the strip stays a change instrument.

    G=/home/geethen.singh/.pixi/envs/geo/bin/python

    # the usual: bake all four schemes for a batch, then rewrite the batch
    $G src/build_batch_chips.py --batch app/batches/b001.json \
        --combo SWIR1/NIR/GREEN NIR/RED/GREEN NIR/SWIR1/RED RED/GREEN/BLUE

    # just the default, a wider footprint, and the old global ramp
    $G src/build_batch_chips.py --batch app/batches/b001.json \
        --width 1280 --stretch fixed

    # what it would do, without touching Earth Engine
    $G src/build_batch_chips.py --batch app/batches/b001.json --dry-run

Re-runs are **resumable**: a point whose sprite is on disk **and was drawn by
the current `CHIP_BAKE_VERSION`** is skipped — a version bump re-bakes the
whole directory on its own, because the app refuses to serve sprites it does
not know the version of and skipping them would strand the batch on the live
path. Otherwise: a point whose sprite is already on disk is skipped,
which matters because a hundred points is 10-60 minutes of Earth Engine and a
revoked token halfway through should not mean starting again. `--force`
re-bakes.

#: through the fixed bounds and would disagree with a chip2 tint, so the bump is
#: not cosmetic -- an un-rebaked batch must fall back rather than mix the two.
#:
#: chip2 -> chip3: the marks. A chip2 sprite carries one red ring at
#: `max(width_m * 0.02, 6)` m, which is 6x the area of the cell being called and
#: changes size with the width slider; chip3 carries the labelling cell itself
#: (`src/label_cell.py`) with the ring demoted to a white locator. The app draws
#: that same cell on the map, so a chip2 sprite next to a chip3 map shows the

#: THE STRETCH IS PER POINT, AND SHARED BY ALL NINE YEARS.

#: dense canopy both run 0.35-0.5, so two of three channels peg at 255 while
#: Green (~0.08) does not -- which is why a desert point bakes as flat cream and
#: a lake as flat black. Measured on the chip1 bake of b001, over all 900
#: year-cells: 55 cells more than half-saturated, 38 more than half-floored, 101
#: more at sd < 6, and a MEDIAN 98th percentile of 252/255. A quarter of the
#: filmstrip was one colour, and the interpreter cannot read what is not there.
#:
#: Per band, per point, from the point's own nine years -- and NEVER per year.
#: A per-year auto-stretch would renormalise each cell independently, which is
#: precisely the thing a change filmstrip must not do: it makes a real
#: brightening invisible and a stable point flicker. The years share one ramp so
#: a difference between cells is a difference on the ground.
STRETCH_PCT = (2, 98)

#: The only guard, and it is against infinite gain rather than against a wide
#: ramp. A uniform surface -- open water, a dune field -- has a percentile pair
#: a few DN apart, and mapping four DN onto 0-255 shows sensor noise as though
