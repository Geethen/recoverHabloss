"""Cut a ranked candidate table into labelling batches for ``app/label_app.html``.

Why batches, and why small ones
-------------------------------
This is not a packaging convenience. ``ACTIVE_LEARNING.md`` §AL4 measured the
**same 2,000 acquisitions** at **-0.003** change-F1 delivered as one batch and
**+0.031** delivered as twenty, against a paired floor of 0.016. A one-shot
campaign throws the model-in-the-loop half of the design away entirely -- and if
the labelling workflow genuinely cannot return batches, §AL4's own conclusion is
to delete that half rather than run it once.

§AL5 then separated batch *size* from the *schedule*: a hand-built
explore-then-exploit schedule tied random, while simply cutting the same budget
into more batches did not. §AL6 separated batch granularity from *start size* and
found the start size is what matters. So the default here is 100 -- small enough
that the model is refitted often, large enough to be a sitting for an
interpreter -- and there is deliberately no schedule parameter.

What this script does NOT decide
--------------------------------
The *ranking*. Candidates arrive already scored, from whichever channel produced
them, and this script preserves that order: batch 1 is ranks 1-100. The two
channels are kept in **separate batches**, not interleaved, because they are two
objectives with two different instruments and are priced on different metrics:

    change-F1                 -> more labels; `entropy` in many small batches
    the map's stable errors   -> coverage: `novelty` / `kcenter`, terrain-strat.
    plots of Artificial -> Cropland -> the retrieval channel, kept small

Mixing them into one batch makes the campaign unreadable: you cannot attribute a
movement in `natStab_as_art` to the coverage points if the batch also carried
retrieval points.

    # a runnable demo batch from the 100-patch equal-area pilot draw

    $G src/build_label_batches.py --candidates ... \
        --exclude-labelled data/analysis_results/round1_labels.csv

    # a calibration batch from plots that already have an agreed answer, which

Writes ``app/batches/<prefix>NNN.json`` plus ``app/batches/index.json``, which is
the manifest the app's batch dropdown reads.
