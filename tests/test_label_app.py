"""Browser regression tests for the ways the labelling app lost or blocked work.

All four were live bugs, all four were silent, and none is visible from reading
a diff -- which is why they are pinned here rather than described in a comment:

1. **Unsent rows were dropped when the labeller switched batches.** The dirty
   set was rebuilt per batch, so rows from a half-finished batch became
   unreachable until somebody happened to reopen exactly that batch. A labeller
   who did half of A, moved to B and closed the tab had silently not delivered.
2. **CSV ids were coerced to numbers**, so a `point_id` of `0012` arrived as
   `12`. The join back to the candidate table breaks and nothing complains until
   the *next* round's `--exclude-labelled` excludes nothing.
3. **The app never asked the sheet what it already held.** Two people on one
   batch each did all of it, and a labeller on a second machine saw 0 / 100.
4. **The boot backstop covered a working app.** It tested the loading overlay's
   message text, which `hideLoading()` leaves in place, so any batch without an
   `instructions` field got an overlay dropped back over it fifteen seconds in.
5. **The annotation key did not carry the expert.** `Code.gs` upserted on
   `(campaign, batch_id, point_id)`, so the second reader's row REPLACED the
   first -- deleting the inter-rater agreement measurement, which is the
   campaign's only handle on the label noise that caps change-F1. The failure was
   invisible from Python, because the mock below implements the key the docs
   describe rather than the one `Code.gs` implemented. That is why the tests for
   it read the JavaScript source directly.

The fix for (3) carries its own hazard, pinned here too: a second reader may be
told *that* someone holds a point, and never *what they said*. Showing the first
reading turns the agreement measurement -- the campaign's only handle on the
label noise that caps change-F1 -- into a confirmation measurement.

These need a browser. They skip cleanly where there is not one, so `pytest -q`
stays green on a bare checkout.
