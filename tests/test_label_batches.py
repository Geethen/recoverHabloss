"""Invariants of the labelling round-trip (docs/research/ACTIVE_LEARNING.md §AL7).

These lock down the properties the campaign design leans on rather than the
numbers: that the ranked order survives the cut into batches, that the manifest
accumulates across rounds instead of orphaning a half-finished batch, that
unknown candidate columns reach the interpreter as context, that an earlier
round's points can be excluded from the next one, and -- on the read-back side --
that a re-label by the same person is a correction while a second person's read
is kept, because that is the only measurement of label noise the campaign makes.
